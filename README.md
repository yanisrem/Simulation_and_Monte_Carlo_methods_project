# **Simulation and Monte Carlo methods project: Unbiaised gradient**

Second year project at ENSAE, in the framework of the "Simulation and Monte Carlo methods". Grade! 18 out 20.

## **Key Idea**

Replication of the first experiment of the article ("On Multilevel Monte Carlo Unbiased Gradient Estimation For Deep Latent Variable Models", Y. Shi, R. Cornish, 2021) 

Topic: Constructing unbiased estimators of the log-likelihood and its gradient using Monte Carlo methods. Compare estimators with existing ones. Integrate the estimators into the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
