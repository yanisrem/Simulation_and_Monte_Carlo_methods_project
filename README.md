Replication of the first experiment of the article ("On Multilevel Monte Carlo Unbiased Gradient Estimation
For Deep Latent Variable Models", Y. Shi, R. Cornish, 2021)  in the framework of the "Simulation and Monte Carlo methods" course at ENSAE.

Topic: Constructing unbiased estimators of the log-likelihood and its gradient using Monte Carlo methods. Compare estimators with existing ones. Integrate the estimators into the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
